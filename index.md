Hi there, I am Tom, an Electronics Engineer from Belgium that is passionate
about space engineering. If you are reading this then you are either interested in
what I am doing and want to learn more, or you want to hire me. In either of those
two cases you are in for a ride.

I am currently part of the Flight Control Team of [OPS-SAT](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/OPS-SAT), a cutting edge mission by
ESA - European Space Agency. My official position is a [YGT](https://www.esa.int/About_Us/Careers_at_ESA/Graduates_Young_Graduate_Trainees) Mission Operations Concept
Engineer at ESOC in Darmstadt.
