In 2018, Tom Mladenov has been awarded the academic degree of Master of Science specialisation Electronics and ICT Engineering Technology by the Belgian universities of [Hasselt](https://www.uhasselt.be/en) and [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/) with great distinction. In 2014 he received both the Flemish Peter Heller talent Award and the PXL Tech Award for the MARS project (Mobile Adaptive Radio System). In 2018 he was the first European to have reported a signal from ESA’s ESEO microsatellite.

In 2019 he was awarded the Special Mention of the Jury by ESA’s Space Sustainability Award during the 21st European Interparliamentary Space Conference (EISC) in Berlin. Tom Mladenov also participated in the ESA’s [REXUS/BEXUS](http://rexusbexus.net/) programme where he acted as RF-Electronics design Engineer. The project comprised of miniaturizing a laboratory setup targeting Electric Readout of NV spin center in Diamond enabling quantum Magnetic Field Detection. The next iteration of the design is planned to be hosted on-board the International Space Station using the ICE Cubes service.

Through various other space-related courses and projects, both intra- and extracurricular, he obtained unique know-how and hands-on skills primarily in the field of satellite operations automation as well as communications and groundstation engineering. His professional interests include, but are not limited to:

* satellite groundstation development (GEO, LEO and MEO)
* innovative deployment technology
* optical groundstations
* satellite acquisition and tracking
* opto-electronic tracking & control systems
* telemetry/telecommand systems
* RF and optical satellite monitoring
* signals intelligence (SIGINT) for improved space situational awareness (SSA)

Tom currently works as a YGT at the European Space Agency as part of the Flight Control Team (FCT) for ESA’s [OPS-SAT](https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/OPS-SAT) mission, operated from the European Space Operations Centre located in Darmstadt, Germany.
